This is the README of this repository. During your work on this repository, you should start writing about what you did and how this repository is organized. For now, I added the following file:
	.gitignore: Choose which files should be ignored by git (such as large files containing data). You will need this, so please also document what downloads you code needs.

For further information on the project, see [LINK TO REPO], or [LINK TO REPO] for general information.

Suggestions:
- Find out how to use GitHub Projects to organize your work
- Find out how to load functions from separate file to keep markdown readable
- Find out how to use GitHub Discussions. That way, you might get answers directly from AG Rohr in case I cannot answer a specific question.
